### Theory

The thermal comfort for children and adults inside the car is a crucial issue to improve as the hot environmental conditions can be irritable and uncomfortable. Being inside an extremely hot car for a prolonged time can lead to major health problems. This paper focuses on the thermal comfort for everyone. Traditionally air conditioning systems are used to cool down an infant car seat which is not effective due to the portability and cooling duration. In this paper, heat relief for the child is researched using a thermoelectric cooling system. This paper reviews various factors concerning the development of a temperature-controlled  car seat. This study focuses on the health and safety of children and adults inside the cars, the subjective needs of the people, heat management in the car cabin environment, thermoelectric modeling, and the methods for precise temperature control for effective thermoelectric cooling. In-depth research has been conducted on the contributions of other researchers on the thermoelectric cooling system in a car. The thermoelectric device in the car seat was tested simulation.

### Simulation

The Coding part of the application is written in C language in CodeBlocks IDE and the simulation of working product is shown in SimulIDE software. Below are the two images of application working while in On and Off conditions.
